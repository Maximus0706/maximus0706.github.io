        <h2 style="text-align:center; color: orange;">These are the characteristics of the amazing Zane. It all started on August 28, 2018 at 7:29 AM, while waiting for his day to start at school, Zane decided to pass down the time by playing Fortnite. While plaing a match for a good 12 minutes, at 7:41 AM, Zane got his first Solo Victory Royale. But Zane's awesomeness doesn't stop there. The next day at 12:54 PM Zane got an amazing 53.132 seconds on Daily Set Game, putting him onto the leaderboard with the other GOATs. Wow! isn't Zane the greatest.</h2>
